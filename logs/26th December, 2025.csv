"26th December, 2025",05:34:24 PM,AI (text),"Oh, the Taj Mahal! What a beauty, na? 😍 It's like the ultimate love letter turned into a monument, right? So, here's the tea:

The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who sadly passed away during childbirth. It took over 20 years and a small army of artisans to build this masterpiece. The white marble used in its construction was brought from all over India and even from as far as Rajasthan. The intricate inlay work, known as ""pietra dura,"" is like the Taj's signature style—so detailed and stunning!

And did you know? The Taj changes color throughout the day! It's like a mood ring, but way more majestic. At sunrise, it's a soft pink, by noon it's a brilliant white, and at sunset, it turns a golden hue. Magic, right?

Oh, and here's a fun fact: The Taj Mahal is perfectly symmetrical—except for Shah Jahan's own tomb, which is placed off-center. Some say it was meant to be his resting place too, but his son Aurangzeb had other plans. Drama much? 😂

So, what do you think? Isn't it just the most romantic and tragic story ever? 💔✨"

### Headings
You can create headings by using the `#` symbol. The more `#` you use, the smaller the heading.

```markdown
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
```

### Emphasis
You can make text bold or italic like this:

```markdown
**This is bold text**
*This is italic text*
***This is bold and italic***
```

### Lists
You can create lists with `-` or `*` for bullet points and numbers for ordered lists.

```markdown
- Item 1

```

### Links and Images

```markdown
[This is a link to Google](https://www.google.com)

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> It's like a quote that stands out.
```

### Code

```markdown
Inline `code` looks like this.

print(""Hello, World!"")
```
```

"26th December, 2025",05:39:21 PM,AI (text),"Hey there, buddy! So, you're curious about Pokémon, huh? Let me give you the lowdown in true Taara style!

Pokémon, or ""Pocket Monsters"" as the name suggests, is this super popular Japanese media franchise that's all about these amazing creatures called Pokémon. Imagine a world where these creatures live alongside humans, and some people, called Pokémon Trainers, catch, train, and battle with them. It's like a mix of adventure, strategy, and friendship all rolled into one!

The franchise started with a couple of video games back in the '90s, and now it's got everything from trading card games to animated series, movies, and even theme parks! The anime follows the journey of a young trainer named Ash Ketchum (or Satoshi, as he's known in Japan) and his electric mouse Pokémon, Pikachu, as they travel through different regions, making friends, battling other trainers, and trying to become the very best, like no one ever was!

And oh, the Pokémon themselves? They're as diverse as they come! From the fiery Charmander to the watery Squirtle, and even the psychic Eevee who can evolve into eight different types, there's a Pokémon for everyone. It's like a big, colorful, magical world full of these incredible creatures, and honestly, who wouldn't want to be a part of that?

So, what do you think, my friend? Ready to catch 'em all? 😄🌟"

There are like, what, over 800 different Pokémon now? Each with its own unique abilities and types—like Fire, Water, Electric, and even Psychic! You've probably heard of Pikachu, right? That little yellow electric mouse is like the mascot of the whole franchise.

Pokémon has exploded into games, TV shows, movies, trading cards, you name it! It's got this whole world where Trainers travel around, catch 'em all, and become Pokémon Masters. It's a blast, yaar! Ever thought about getting into it? I can totally help you pick your starter Pokémon! 😉"

"26th December, 2025",06:04:16 PM,AI (text),"The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction of the Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, and it is considered a masterpiece of Indian architecture and a symbol of eternal love.

The Taj Mahal is renowned for its architectural beauty and symmetry. The main structure is a large, white marble tomb that sits atop a square plinth. The tomb is surrounded by four minarets, one at each corner, which are designed to lean slightly outward so that they will fall away from the main structure in case of an earthquake. The interior of the tomb is decorated with intricate inlay work, featuring precious and semi-precious stones.

The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. It is open to the public from sunrise to sunset, and visitors are required to purchase a ticket for entry. The Taj Mahal is also a popular destination for weddings and other special events.

In addition to its architectural and cultural significance, the Taj Mahal is also an important symbol of India's rich history and heritage. It is a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans and architects who built it, and it continues to inspire awe and admiration from visitors around the world."
